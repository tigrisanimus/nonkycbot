ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND ATTRIBUTIONS

Inspiration:
------------
This project was inspired by the NonKYC fork of Hummingbot, an open-source
algorithmic trading bot. While this is a standalone implementation with its
own architecture, the NonKYC Hummingbot fork provided valuable inspiration
for trading strategies and exchange integration patterns.

Development Tools:
------------------
This software was developed with the assistance of AI-powered coding tools:
- ChatGPT Codex (OpenAI)
- Claude Code (Anthropic)

These tools were instrumental in the design, implementation, and documentation
of this project.
