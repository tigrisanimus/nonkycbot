# Infinity Grid Bot Configuration
# Maintains constant base asset value with no upper limit, optimal for bull markets
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Store your API credentials securely in the OS keychain (RECOMMENDED):
#    python nonkyc_store_credentials.py --api-key "your_key" --api-secret "your_secret"
#
#    The bot will automatically load credentials from the keychain.
#    DO NOT edit api_key/api_secret below - leave them commented out!
#
# 2. Run the bot:
#    python run_infinity_grid.py examples/infinity_grid.yml
#
# WHAT THIS BOT DOES:
# - REBALANCE STRATEGY: Does NOT create a ladder of standing orders
# - Waits for price to move by step_pct, then places a SINGLE rebalance order
# - You will see "No rebalance needed" frequently - THIS IS NORMAL!
# - TWO-SIDED GRID: Requires BOTH base asset (BTC) and quote asset (USDT)
# - Maintains a constant value in the base asset (e.g., $50,000 in BTC)
# - When price rises by step_pct, sells base to maintain constant value (profit = sale amount)
# - When price drops by step_pct, buys base using allocated USDT to restore constant value
# - NO UPPER LIMIT - profits can grow indefinitely in bull markets
# - Has LOWER LIMIT calculated from USDT allocation (stops buying when USDT depleted)
# - Best for trending bull markets with consistent upward movement
#
# IMPORTANT: This is DIFFERENT from run_grid.py (ladder grid):
# - Ladder grid: Creates many standing orders immediately
# - Infinity grid: Only places orders AFTER price moves (reactive, not proactive)
