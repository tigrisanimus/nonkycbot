# Infinity Grid Bot Configuration
# Maintains constant base asset value with no upper limit, optimal for bull markets
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Store your API credentials securely in the OS keychain (RECOMMENDED):
#    python nonkyc_store_credentials.py --api-key "your_key" --api-secret "your_secret"
#
#    The bot will automatically load credentials from the keychain.
#    DO NOT edit api_key/api_secret below - leave them commented out!
#
# 2. Run the bot:
#    python run_infinity_grid.py examples/infinity_grid.yml
#
# WHAT THIS BOT DOES:
# - TWO-SIDED GRID: Requires BOTH base asset (BTC) and quote asset (USDT)
# - Maintains a constant value in the base asset (e.g., $50,000 in BTC)
# - When price rises by step_pct, sells base to maintain constant value (profit = sale amount)
# - When price drops by step_pct, buys base using allocated USDT to restore constant value
# - NO UPPER LIMIT - profits can grow indefinitely in bull markets
# - Has LOWER LIMIT calculated from USDT allocation (stops buying when USDT depleted)
# - Best for trending bull markets with consistent upward movement

# Exchange settings
