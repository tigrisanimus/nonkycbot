# Infinity Grid Backup Snapshot

This directory contains a refreshed snapshot of the **current working** infinity
ladder grid bot implementation used by `run_infinity_grid.py`.

## Contents
- `run_infinity_grid.py.bak`: Runner for the infinity ladder grid bot.
- `infinity_ladder_grid.py.bak`: Strategy implementation (order placement,
  reconciliation, and state handling).

## Source of Truth
Live sources remain:
- `run_infinity_grid.py`
- `src/strategies/infinity_ladder_grid.py`

Refresh this backup whenever the working bot implementation changes.
This snapshot matches the current working runner (`run_infinity_grid.py`) and
strategy implementation (`src/strategies/infinity_ladder_grid.py`) in the
repository at the time it was captured.
